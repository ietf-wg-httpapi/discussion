# Discussion of HTTP APIs

This repo is an alternative venue for discussion in the [IETF HTTPAPI Working Group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/httpapi/about/). In particular, ideas for new specifications can be discussed here before they are taking to the [mailing list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/httpapi) for a Call for Adoption.

Note that discussion of specifications already adopted by the HTTPAPI Working Group take place in their [respective repositories](https://github.com/ietf-wg-httpapi), not here.

**All discussion in this repo is under the [IETF NOTE WELL](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/) policy.**
